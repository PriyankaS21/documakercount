2021-07-27 18:41:41,038:INFO:DocumakerCount:New England Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since New England Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,048:INFO:DocumakerCount:New England Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since New England Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since New England Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,113:INFO:DocumakerCount:New England Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since New England Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,158:INFO:DocumakerCount:New England Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,188:INFO:DocumakerCount:New England Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since New England Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,220:INFO:DocumakerCount:New England Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since New England Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,243:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,280:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,306:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,342:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,399:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,428:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,457:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,495:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,525:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,556:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,614:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,652:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,684:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost. The exact amount of additional insurance will depend upon your attained age and the amount of your dividend. Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

Your additional insurance has a cash value, which is guaranteed never to be less than the sum of the annual dividends that buy the protection. Moreover, the cash value of the additional insurance is not currently taxable to you and it will increase on a tax-deferred basis in the future. Q. What happens if I cash in my Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. If you apply the value of your paid-up insurance to pay all or part of your premiums, you will not be subject to income tax. If you cash in or make a withdrawal from your Additional Paid-up Insurance, you will be subject to income tax to the extent the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, that is, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. However, if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract (MEC), you will be subject to tax to the extent of any gain in your policy. Q. How do I change my dividend option? A. It’s easy. Simply complete the return portion of the enclosed letter and send it to us at the address listed on the form. While we are happy to share our views, you should consult with and rely on the advice of your own counsel since Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is not in the position to provide tax advice or guarantee tax results.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,716:INFO:DocumakerCount:Metropolitan Life Insurance Company IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY DIVIDENDS Your life insurance policy can help provide you with a lifetime of financial security and peace of mind. However, that’s not all your MetLife policy has to offer. One of the most attractive features of your policy is that it permits you to receive dividends. What you do with these dividends – and which dividend option you choose – is completely up to you. Depending on your financial situation - and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service may view certain dividend payments as taxable income - it may be to your advantage to change your dividend option to have dividends purchase Additional Paid-up Insurance. This tax information is based on current federal laws. These laws are subject to legislative change and to judicial and administrative interpretation. We recommend that you consult with your own professional tax advisor. Frequently Asked Questions Additional Paid-up Insurance? A. A change may make sense when: Q. When does it make sense to change my Dividend Option to have dividends used to purchase Any current or future dividends may be considered taxable income to you - that is, when the amount received exceeds your tax basis in the policy, or, generally speaking, when dividends received exceed the total amount of premium payments. You would like additional insurance protection - in most cases without having to provide evidence of insurability. Q. What are the advantages of changing to the Additional Paid-up Insurance option? A. When you choose the Additional Paid-up Insurance option, all future dividends used to purchase additional insurance (and any resulting increase in the cash value of additional insurance) are not taxable under current federal income tax law. What’s more, the Additional Paid-up Insurance option offers you these benefits; You receive increased insurance protection at no additional out-of-pocket cost.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,740:INFO:DocumakerCount:SECTION A CASH SURRENDER PAYMENTS We urge you to consider carefully your decision to surrender your policy. The reasons you bought this policy may still exist, and new insurance may not be available at as low a cost. If you need any assistance, our local sales office would be glad to be of help. Although payment of the Cash Surrender value has terminated this policy, an additional amount may be payable if: (1) the insured dies on or before the “Insurance Coverage To” date which will appear on the front of this statement if it applies to your policy. (2) or, the policy contained a disability benefit and the insured becomes disabled on or before the “Insurance Coverage To” date which will appear on the front of this statement if it applies to your policy. (3) or, any dividend associated with the policy was used to purchase one year term insurance and the insured dies before the term insurance expires. (4) or, the policy contained a Family Income provision for which premiums had been paid for the full number of years specified in that provision and the insured dies before the expiration date of that provision. Please note that if an “Insurance Coverage To” date appears on the front of this statement your policy does not have a provision for fully refunding premiums. If your policy provides for premium refunds then that refund has been included in your surrender. If you wish to apply for new insurance sometime in the future, we will appreciate the opportunity to consider your application. The release of policy values as a result of this transaction may affect the guaranteed elements, nonguaranteed elements, face amount or surrender value of the policy from which the values are released. If you have other policies that require service, please contact us regarding those policies if you have not already done so. SECTION B FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW FOR CASH SURRENDERS Federal income tax law requires us to tell you that the amount(s) received from your policy in excess of your investment in the contract is taxable as ordinary income. Certain taxable payments from life insurance policies are subject to federal income tax withholding. However, IRS regulations permit us to assume that our payment to you is not subject to withholding. This does not mean that the payment is not taxable. While we are required to furnish you this statement, the IRS does not require us to send a 1099-R information report to you or the IRS.

2021-07-27 18:41:41,790:INFO:DocumakerCount:SECTION A CASH SURRENDER PAYMENTS We urge you to consider carefully your decision to surrender your policy. The reasons you bought this policy may still exist, and new insurance may not be available at as low a cost. If you need any assistance, our local sales office would be glad to be of help. Although payment of the Cash Surrender value has terminated this policy, an additional amount may be payable if: (1) the insured dies on or before the “Insurance Coverage To” date which will appear on the front of this statement if it applies to your policy. (2) or, the policy contained a disability benefit and the insured becomes disabled on or before the “Insurance Coverage To” date which will appear on the front of this statement if it applies to your policy. (3) or, any dividend associated with the policy was used to purchase one year term insurance and the insured dies before the term insurance expires. (4) or, the policy contained a Family Income provision for which premiums had been paid for the full number of years specified in that provision and the insured dies before the expiration date of that provision. Please note that if an “Insurance Coverage To” date appears on the front of this statement your policy does not have a provision for fully refunding premiums. If your policy provides for premium refunds then that refund has been included in your surrender. If you wish to apply for new insurance sometime in the future, we will appreciate the opportunity to consider your application. The release of policy values as a result of this transaction may affect the guaranteed elements, nonguaranteed elements, face amount or surrender value of the policy from which the values are released. If you have other policies that require service, please contact us regarding those policies if you have not already done so. SECTION B FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW FOR CASH SURRENDERS Federal income tax law requires us to tell you that the amount(s) received from your policy in excess of your investment in the contract is taxable as ordinary income. Certain taxable payments from life insurance policies are subject to federal income tax withholding. However, IRS regulations permit us to assume that our payment to you is not subject to withholding. This does not mean that the payment is not taxable. While we are required to furnish you this statement, the IRS does not require us to send a 1099-R information report to you or the IRS.

Though the Company does not tax report these transactions, the transferor generally must include in gross income the amount of the loan in excess of basis at the time of the transfer and as a result, the transferee's (new owner) basis would increase by a corresponding amount (“basis adjustment”). It is the transferor’s (previous owner’s) responsibility to inform the Company of any basis adjustments in this context. The Company, its affiliates and subsidiaries, do not provide tax advice. Please consult a tax advisor with questions regarding your personal tax situation. Keep this information with your important papers.

We also sent the new owner a confirmation notice. Please further note - generally, when a transferor (previous owner) makes a gratuitous transfer of a life insurance policy subject to an outstanding loan that exceeds the policy’s basis (premiums paid in excess of any prior nontaxable distributions), the transfer may be considered in part a gift and in part a sale. Though the Company does not tax report these transactions, the transferor generally must include in gross income the amount of the loan in excess of basis at the time of the transfer and as a result, the transferee's (new owner) basis would increase by a corresponding amount (“basis adjustment”). It is the transferor’s (previous owner’s) responsibility to inform the Company of any basis adjustments in this context. The Company, its affiliates and subsidiaries, do not provide tax advice. Please consult a tax advisor with questions regarding your personal tax situation.

While the loan remains unpaid, interest is payable each year on the policy anniversary date. Unpaid interest will be automatically added to the amount of loan principal and will bear interest, if any, may be repaid any time while the policy is active. You may repay a loan in full or partial amounts as indicated in the terms of your policy. Repayments not only reduce the loan principal, but also help restore the insurance protection the policy was meant to provide. Please send these loan payments directly to the following address: New England Life Insurance Company PO BOX 71114 CHARLOTTE, NC 28272-1114 Be sure to indicate “loan repayment” and/or “loan interest payment” (if applicable) and the policy number on your check so your payment will be properly credited.

Your policy’s cash surrender value as of July 16, 2021 is $0.00 Here’s a brief description of the lapse options available on your policy: Extended Term Insurance (ETI): ETI is life insurance for a limited term with no further premiums due. It has decreasing cash value, but no loan value. It does not share in dividends. The amount of ETI is payable only if the Insured dies prior to the end of the term. At the end of the term, this Policy will be void. ETI will be measured from the due date of the premium in default. We will compute the length of ETI provided by using the Cash Surrender Value of the Policy to purchase the term insurance benefit. Reduced Paid-Up Insurance (RPU): RPU Insurance is permanent life insurance with no further premiums due. It has increasing cash value and loan value and shares in dividends. The amount of RPU Insurance is payable at the death of the insured. The amount of RPU insurance will be provided using the Cash Surrender Value of the Policy as a net single premium at the age of the Insured on the due date of the premium in default. Any riders will lapse unless otherwise stated in the rider. Any Dividend Accumulations, Paid-Up Additions and Policy Loan will terminate when the Surrender Value is used for this purpose. Please refer to your policy for complete details. Deciding to protect those who depend on you with a sufficient amount of life insurance was a responsible and caring act. You created solid protection for your family that should make you feel good about your decision. Many people find that over time or suddenly, their family or business situation may have changed. A review of your current life insurance needs can ensure your protection is complete, up to date and will continue to provide a lifetime of financial security for those who depend on you.

2021-07-27 18:41:42,370:INFO:DocumakerCount:Additional Information Here’s a brief description of the lapse options available on your policy: Extended Term Insurance (ETI): ETI is life insurance for a limited term with no further premiums due. It has decreasing cash value, but no loan value. It does not share in dividends. The amount of ETI is payable only if the Insured dies prior to the end of the term. At the end of the term, this Policy will be void. ETI will be measured from the due date of the premium in default. We will compute the length of ETI provided by using the Cash Surrender Value of the Policy to purchase the term insurance benefit. Reduced Paid-Up Insurance (RPU): RPU Insurance is permanent life insurance with no further premiums due. It has increasing cash value and loan value and shares in dividends. The amount of RPU Insurance is payable at the death of the insured. The amount of RPU insurance will be provided using the Cash Surrender Value of the Policy as a net single premium at the age of the Insured on the due date of the premium in default. Any riders will lapse unless otherwise stated in the rider. Any Dividend Accumulations, Paid-Up Additions and Policy Loan will terminate when the Surrender Value is used for this purpose. Please refer to your policy for complete details. Deciding to protect those who depend on you with a sufficient amount of life insurance was a responsible and caring act. You created solid protection for your family that should make you feel good about your decision. Many people find that over time or suddenly, their family or business situation may have changed. A review of your current life insurance needs can ensure your protection is complete, up to date and will continue to provide a lifetime of financial security for those who depend on you. Your representative can review your existing insurance to ensure you achieve your financial goals.

It has decreasing cash value, but no loan value. It does not share in dividends. The amount of ETI is payable only if the Insured dies prior to the end of the term. At the end of the term, this Policy will be void. ETI will be measured from the due date of the premium in default. We will compute the length of ETI provided by using the Cash Surrender Value of the Policy to purchase the term insurance benefit. Reduced Paid-Up Insurance (RPU): RPU Insurance is permanent life insurance with no further premiums due. It has increasing cash value and loan value and shares in dividends. The amount of RPU Insurance is payable at the death of the insured. The amount of RPU insurance will be provided using the Cash Surrender Value of the Policy as a net single premium at the age of the Insured on the due date of the premium in default. Any riders will lapse unless otherwise stated in the rider. Any Dividend Accumulations, Paid-Up Additions and Policy Loan will terminate when the Surrender Value is used for this purpose. Please refer to your policy for complete details. Deciding to protect those who depend on you with a sufficient amount of life insurance was a responsible and caring act. You created solid protection for your family that should make you feel good about your decision. Many people find that over time or suddenly, their family or business situation may have changed. A review of your current life insurance needs can ensure your protection is complete, up to date and will continue to provide a lifetime of financial security for those who depend on you. Your representative can review your existing insurance to ensure you achieve your financial goals.

What you need to know This policy now provides that if premium payments are stopped, any available cash value will automatically continue the policy as reduced paid-up insurance. The policy owner continues to have the same rights available, including the right to surrender the policy for its cash value, the right to receive dividends if the insurance amount is sufficient to earn a dividend and the right to take a loan against the values in the policy. Your policy contains the Automatic Premium Loan (APL) option. Any unpaid premiums will be borrowed from your policy value if sufficient.If there is insufficient value to borrow the premium due and you do not pay the premium out of pocket, your policy will continue as reduced paid-up insurance, but the length of coverage may be greatly reduced due to the limited value remaining in your policy. What you need to do If you would like the policy to automatically continue as reduced paid-up, don’t pay any further premiums. About three months after the date your first unpaid premium was due, we will send you a notice explaining the benefits that apply to your policy. In view of the valuable insurance protection your policy has been providing, we hope you consider the matter very carefully before making a decision to discontinue premium payments.

What you need to know Under this payment arrangement, a withdrawal from your policy’s dividend balance will pay the annual premium as long as there is sufficient withdrawable cash value in the policy. You will continue to receive a billing notice approximately four weeks before the anniversary date of your policy. At that time, you will have the option of either paying the premium yourself or having it paid by the APO arrangement. If you do not pay the premium, the APO arrangement will pay the premium 21 days after the due date. Please review the following information with respect to the APO: This method of paying premiums does not make the policy “paid up” nor does it reduce the number of premiums that must be paid. Rather, the APO arrangement allows you to pay your premiums using policy values as long as there is sufficient cash value in the policy. The current dividend scale is not guaranteed for the future. A future decrease in dividends may require you to make out-of-pocket premium payments. Certain transactions can affect or terminate the APO arrangement. For example, if you take a policy loan, fail to pay loan interest, withdraw from policy values, change your dividend option, or change your frequency of payment to other than annual, you may need to resume out-of-pocket premium payments.

Though the Company does not tax report these transactions, the transferor generally must include in gross income the amount of the loan in excess of basis at the time of the transfer and as a result, the transferee's (new owner) basis would increase by a corresponding amount (“basis adjustment”).

Please consult a tax advisor with questions regarding your personal tax situation. If you accept these terms, no further action is required.

2021-07-27 18:41:42,640:INFO:DocumakerCount:SECTION A CASH SURRENDER PAYMENTS We urge you to consider carefully your decision to surrender your policy. The reasons you bought this policy may still exist, and new insurance may not be available at as low a cost. If you need any assistance, our local sales office would be glad to be of help. Although payment of the Cash Surrender value has terminated this policy, an additional amount may be payable if: (1) the insured dies on or before the “Insurance Coverage To” date which will appear on the front of this statement if it applies to your policy. (2) or, the policy contained a disability benefit and the insured becomes disabled on or before the “Insurance Coverage To” date which will appear on the front of this statement if it applies to your policy. (3) or, any dividend associated with the policy was used to purchase one year term insurance and the insured dies before the term insurance expires. (4) or, the policy contained a Family Income provision for which premiums had been paid for the full number of years specified in that provision and the insured dies before the expiration date of that provision. Please note that if an “Insurance Coverage To” date appears on the front of this statement your policy does not have a provision for fully refunding premiums. If your policy provides for premium refunds then that refund has been included in your surrender. If you wish to apply for new insurance sometime in the future, we will appreciate the opportunity to consider your application. The release of policy values as a result of this transaction may affect the guaranteed elements, nonguaranteed elements, face amount or surrender value of the policy from which the values are released. If you have other policies that require service, please contact us regarding those policies if you have not already done so. SECTION B FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW FOR CASH SURRENDERS Federal income tax law requires us to tell you that the amount(s) received from your policy in excess of your investment in the contract is taxable as ordinary income. Certain taxable payments from life insurance policies are subject to federal income tax withholding. However, IRS regulations permit us to assume that our payment to you is not subject to withholding. This does not mean that the payment is not taxable. While we are required to furnish you this statement, the IRS does not require us to send a 1099-R information report to you or the IRS.
